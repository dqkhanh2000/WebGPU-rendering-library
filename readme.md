# WebGPU Rendering Library

Welcome to the WebGPU Rendering Library! This library is a collection of tools and functions for creating high-performance GPU-accelerated graphics using the WebGPU API.

## Installation

To install the library, first make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) installed on your development machine. Then, clone this repository and run the following commands:

<pre><div class="bg-black mb-4 rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre-wrap hljs language-sh">npm install
npm run dev
</code></div></div></pre>

This will start a development server and open the library in your browser. You can now start experimenting with the different functions and examples provided.

## Usage

The library exports a set of classes and functions for creating and manipulating WebGPU resources such as buffers, textures, and shaders. To use the library in your own project, you can import it as follows:

<pre><div class="bg-black mb-4 rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre-wrap hljs language-js">import { createBuffer, createTexture } from 'webgpu-rendering-library';
</code></div></div></pre>

You can also find usage examples in the `/examples` folder of the repository.
